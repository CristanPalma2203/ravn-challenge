# Setup Project

```bash
$ npm install
```

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

# API and Token Configuration
To connect to the GraphQL API, you'll need to update the API URL and token in the project configuration. Since the provided API had some issues, I created a local GraphQL server for development purposes.

You can find the local GraphQL server repository here: https://github.com/CristanPalma2203/GraphQL
